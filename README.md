# Binary Search
Custom implementation of Binary search only by using **ternary operator** in Java

##Time Complexity
`O(log n)`

##Proof of Complexity
Binary Search divides the problem 'n' into 2 parts recursively suppose 'x'  times i.e n / 2^x
On Further calculations comes to be _logn_

##Sample Output
```
Elements : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Key's position: 5
```
